![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1-blue)

> a software engineering team generator command line application. 

The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.. This project was built because  it is an effective way to learn and demonstrate tests and using a command line application to create a styled html page which incorporates user input. The Template Engine - Employee Summary helps solve the problem of  helps solve the problem of having to write out an engineering team and having it displayed in an easy to read format. In the duration of this project, I learned using functions within prompts to get different inputs depending on what the user chooses and classes..
